## Realized Functionality

### Bank Statement Parsers

- `CamtParser`: Class for parsing CAMT format bank statement files.
- `Pain001Parser`: Class for parsing SEPA PAIN.001 credit transfer files.

## Basic Usage

### Parsing CAMT Files

```python
from kktools import CamtParser

# Initialize the parser with the CAMT file path
camt_parser = CamtParser('path/to/camt/file.xml')

# Parse the file and get the results
results = camt_parser.parse()
```

### Parsing PAIN.001 Files

```python
from kktools import Pain001Parser

# Initialize the parser with the PAIN.001 file path
pain_parser = Pain001Parser('path/to/pain/file.xml')

# Parse the file and get the results
results = pain_parser.parse()
```

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

`kktools` also provides a command line interface for parsing bank statement files.

### Usage

```bash
python cli.py --type <file_type> --input <input_file> [--output <output_file>]
```

- `--type`: Type of the bank statement file. Currently supported types are "camt" and "pain001".
- `--input`: Path to the bank statement file.
- `--output`: (Optional) Path to save the parsed data. If not provided, data is printed to the console.

### Examples

1. Parse a CAMT file and print the results to the console:

   ```bash
   python cli.py --type camt --input path/to/camt/file.xml
   ```

   Using the test data:

   ```bash
   python ./kktools/cli.py --type camt --input ./tests/test_data/camt.053.001.02.xml
   ```

2. Parse a CAMT file and save the results to a CSV file:

   ```bash
   python cli.py --type camt --input path/to/camt/file.xml --output path/to/output/file.csv
   ```

   Using the test data:

   ```bash
   python ./kktools/cli.py --type camt --input ./tests/test_data/camt.053.001.02.xml --output ./tests/test_data/file.csv
   ```
